      <description>This talk looked at Liberty Mutual’s transformation to Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps. For a large, heavily regulated industry, this task can not only be daunting, but viewed by many as impossible. Often, organizations try to reduce the friction through micro-fixes, but Eddie’s team asked how to change the culture to reduce the friction and concluded with the following final points:
 Don’t mandate DevOps. Give employees the chance to master their discipline with examples to set and follow.</description>

      <description>CellScope is a specification and verification framework, CellScope, for exploiting design flawsin cellular network protocols. CellScope consists two major components: a parser frontend and a verification backend. The parser front-end automatically translates LTE source code to formal models and instruments channel and adversary models into LTE models. By slicing the model depending on a property, CellScope performs the CEGAR-based verification backend on it. Once a counterexample is identified, it will be validated on a real OAI testbed platform.</description>
