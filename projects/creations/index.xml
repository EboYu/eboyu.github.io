      <description>CellScope is a specification and verification framework, CellScope, for exploiting design flawsin cellular network protocols. CellScope consists two major components: a parser frontend and a verification backend. The parser front-end automatically translates LTE source code to formal models and instruments channel and adversary models into LTE models. By slicing the model depending on a property, CellScope performs the CEGAR-based verification backend on it. Once a counterexample is identified, it will be validated on a real OAI testbed platform.</description>
